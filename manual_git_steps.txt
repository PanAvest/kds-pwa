I am sorry, but I am unable to execute git commands. You will have to manually commit and push the changes.

Here is a summary of the changes I made:
- Disabled certificate downloads.
- Disabled in-app payments for ebooks and courses.
- Created a `changes_summary.txt` file with details of the changes.

The following files were modified:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `app/ebooks/[slug]/page.tsx`
- `app/courses/[slug]/enroll/page.tsx`

The following file was created:
- `changes_summary.txt`
